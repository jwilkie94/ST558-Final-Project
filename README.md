# ST558-Final-Project
The data used in this shiny app was provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) and contains information regarding greenhouse gas emissions for multiple countries from 1990 to 2016. This data set has been modified to remove any rows that are missing data to make the predictive modeling process more accurate for the remaining data. As a result of removing this data, several countries have been omitted.   The original data set along with more information regarding its contents can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).
